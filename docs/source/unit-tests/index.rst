Unit tests
==========

OS2 Valghalla have unit tests implemented in the solution to automatic test the application logic. 
These tests are using MS Test and can be run manually from the solution to see that all the code is working as It should. 
The project has not aimed for 100% code coverage as that would have taken to much time, instead the focus has been on the actual business logic in the application layer.
